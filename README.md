Kozily: Study and interact with the Oz language in a cozy development
environment.

Kozily was created as final project of two Universidad de Buenos Aires,
Facultad de Ingenier√≠a alumni. This repository contains the required
documentation that was presented in this context. It's also the main repository
in which the issues, labels and milestones are tracked, and where other usage
documentation is hosted.
